# Superstore Sales Dashboard

## Data Source

## Background

Every day, the retail industry produces tons of transactional data. Without the right analysis, those numbers don’t mean much. A dashboard turns that raw data into clear visuals, making it easier to spot insights and support smarter business decisions.

To address these challenges, I developed an interactive Tableau dashboard using the Superstore dataset, which represents a U.S.-based retail business. This dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive view of sales performance, profitability, customer retention, and product trends. By combining multiple perspectives into one platform, it allows decision-makers to quickly identify key insights and take data-driven actions.

-  Comparing sales and profit helps identify whether high revenue also translates into healthy margins. According to the Food Industry Association, the average profit margin for grocery store chains between 2011 and 2014 was around 1.9%–2.3% before taxes [1]. In this section, the Superstore dataset shows a profit margin of about 10%, which indicates performance well above the industry average for grocery retailers.
- For customers, the table shows that in 2012 there was a significant drop especially in consumer and corporate segment compared to other years. After 2012, the number of customers steadily increased, reaching its highest point in 2014.


| Year | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 
| ----- | -- | -- | -- | -- | 
| Consumer | 311 | 295 | 330 | 361 |
| Corporate | 179 | 165 | 194 | 204 |
| Home office | 105 | 113 | 113 | 112 |
| Total Customers | 595 | 573 | 637 | 693 |


### Section 2: Profit by Map

This section illustrates how profitable each state is for Superstore. States with higher profitability are shown in darker green, while less profitable states appear lighter. California and New York stand out as the most profitable, suggesting strong potential for business expansion or opening new branches. In contrast, Texas show significant losses, which highlights areas where the business strategy may need to be reevaluated. Wyoming appears with no data, indicating that Superstore may not have any operations or warehouses in that state.
